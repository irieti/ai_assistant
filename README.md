## Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Knowledge Base**

Our knowledge base is the heart of the AI Assistant. It stores essential information, guides, tutorials, and more, which the AI uses to respond to your queries. It can be updated and expanded with ease—no coding needed.

### 2. **No-Coding Solutions**

- Easily update and manage your knowledge base without touching any code.
- Add new information and resources quickly via the admin dashboard.
- Integrate AI-powered tools that can help streamline your business operations.

### 3. **Automated Video Processing**

With our platform, you can process videos and convert them into usable data, such as transcriptions and summaries, ready for use in your knowledge base or other applications.

### 4. **Custom Integrations**

Our AI Assistant can be integrated with external tools to expand its functionality. For example, you can connect it to your video platforms, file storage, or CRM tools to access everything in one place.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Django 4.0+** for web app functionality
3. **OpenAI API Key** for AI capabilities
4. **API Keys** for integrations (e.g., YouTube, Google, etc.)
5. **Google API client** (for accessing certain integrations)
6. **Dotenv** (for managing environment variables)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant.git
   cd ai-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys, database credentials, etc. Example:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

## How to Use

1. **Access the Knowledge Base**: 
   Navigate to the Knowledge Base folder to manage and update your content. You can upload new documents, add notes, and integrate with the AI for smart content retrieval.

2. **Integrate New Tools**:
   Add integrations via the admin interface. You can connect external APIs such as YouTube for video processing or Google for additional data.

3. **Train the AI**:
   Your AI Assistant learns from the knowledge base. To ensure optimal performance, regularly update the knowledge base with new information. The AI uses this to improve its responses.

4. **Video Processing**:
   Upload videos, and the assistant will process them to extract text and key information. This data is then added to your knowledge base.
